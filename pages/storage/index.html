                PC Storage Components SSD and HDD:
            </p>
            <p>
                An HDD is a data storage device that lives inside the computer. It has spinning disks inside where data
                is stored magnetically. The HDD has an arm with several "heads" (transducers) that read and write data
                on the disk. It is similar to how a turntable record player works, with an LP record (hard disk) and a
                needle on an arm (transducers). The arm moves the heads across the surface of the disk to access
                different data.
            </p>
            <p>
                HDDs are considered a legacy technology, meaning they’ve been around longer than SSDs. In general, they
                are lower in cost and are practical for data that does not need to be accessed frequently, such as
                backups of photos, videos or business files. They are available in two common form factors: 2.5 inch
                (commonly used in laptops) and 3.5 inch (desktop computers).
            </p>
            <p>
                SSDs got their name—solid state—because they use solidstate devices under the hood. In an SSD, all data
                is stored in integrated circuits. This difference from HDDs has a lot of implications, especially in
                size and performance. Without the need for a spinning disk, SSDs can reduce to the shape and size of a
                stick of gum (what’s known as the M.2 form factor) or even as small as a postage stamp. Their
                capacity—or how much data they can hold—varies, making them flexible for smaller devices, such as slim
                laptops, convertibles, or 2 in 1s. And SSDs dramatically reduce access time since users don’t have to
                wait for platter rotation to start up.
            </p>
            <p>
                SSDs are more expensive than HDDs per amount of storage (in gigabytes (GB) and terabytes (TB)), but the
                gap is closing as SSD prices decline at a faster pace that HDD prices year over year.
