                Computer cooling is required to remove the waste heat produced by computer components, to keep
                components
                within permissible operating temperature limits. Components that are susceptible to temporary
                malfunction or
                permanent failure if overheated include integrated circuits such as central processing units (CPUs),
                chipsets, graphics cards, and hard disk drives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Components are often designed to generate as little heat as possible, and computers and operating
                systems
                may be designed to reduce power consumption and consequent heating according to workload, but more heat
                may
                still be produced than can be removed without attention to cooling. Use of heatsinks cooled by airflow
                reduces the temperature rise produced by a given amount of heat. Attention to patterns of airflow can
                prevent the development of hotspots. Computer fans are widely used along with heatsink fans to reduce
                temperature by actively exhausting hot air. There are also more exotic cooling techniques, such as
                liquid
                cooling. All modern day processors are designed to cut out or reduce their voltage or clock speed if the
                internal temperature of the processor exceeds a specified limit. This is generally known as Thermal
                Throttling, in the case of reduction of clock speeds or Thermal Shutdown in the case of a complete
                shutdown
                of the device or system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cooling may be designed to reduce the ambient temperature within the case of a computer, such as by
                exhausting hot air, or to cool a single component or small area (spot cooling). Components commonly
                individually cooled include the CPU, graphics processing unit (GPU) and the northbridge.
