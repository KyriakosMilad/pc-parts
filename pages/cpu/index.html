                A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is
                the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs
                basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in
                the program. This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry, and
                specialized processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).
            </p>
            <p>
                The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over time, but their fundamental operation
                remains almost unchanged. Principal components of a CPU include the arithmeticâ€“logic unit (ALU) that
                performs arithmetic and logic operations, processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store
                the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory), decoding
                and execution of instructions by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other
                components.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most modern CPUs are implemented on integrated circuit (IC) microprocessors, with one or more CPUs on a
                single metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) IC chip. Microprocessors chips with multiple CPUs are multi-core
                processors. The individual physical CPUs, processor cores, can also be multithreaded to create
                additional virtual or logical CPUs.
            </p>
            <p>
                An IC that contains a CPU may also contain memory, peripheral interfaces, and other components of a
                computer; such integrated devices are variously called microcontrollers or systems on a chip (SoC).
            </p>
            <p>
                Array processors or vector processors have multiple processors that operate in parallel, with no unit
                considered central. Virtual CPUs are an abstraction of dynamical aggregated computational resources.
