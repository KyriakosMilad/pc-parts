                A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and
                alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display
                device. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game
                consoles.

                Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing. Their highly
                parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) for
                algorithms that process large blocks of data in parallel. In a personal computer, a GPU can be present
                on a video card or embedded on the motherboard. In certain CPUs, they are embedded on the CPU die.

                In the 1970s, the term "GPU" originally stood for graphics processor unit and described a programmable
                processing unit independently working from the CPU and responsible for graphics manipulation and
                output. Later, in 1994, Sony used the term (now standing for graphics processing unit) in
                reference to the PlayStation console's Toshiba-designed Sony GPU in 1994. The term was popularized by
                Nvidia in 1999, who marketed the GeForce 256 as "the world's first GPU". It was presented as a
                "single-chip processor with integrated transform, lighting, triangle setup/clipping, and rendering
                engines". Rival ATI Technologies coined the term "visual processing unit" or VPU with the release of
                the Radeon 9700 in 2002.
