        <!-- Description -->
        <div class="description">
            <p>
                In computing, memory is a device or system that is used to store information for immediate use in a
                computer or related computer hardware and digital electronic devices. The term memory is often
                synonymous with the term primary storage or main memory. An archaic synonym for memory is store.
            </p>
            <p>
                Computer memory operates at a high speed compared to storage that is slower but offers higher
                capacities. If needed, contents of the computer memory can be transferred to storage; a common way of
                doing this is through a memory management technique called virtual memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern memory is implemented as semiconductor memory, where data is stored within memory cells
                built from MOS transistors and other components on an integrated circuit. There are two main kinds of
                semiconductor memory, volatile and non-volatile. Examples of non-volatile memory are flash memory and
                ROM, PROM, EPROM and EEPROM memory. Examples of volatile memory are dynamic random-access memory (DRAM)
                used for primary storage, and static random-access memory (SRAM) used for CPU cache.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most semiconductor memory is organized into memory cells each storing one bit (0 or 1). Flash memory
                organization includes both one bit per memory cell and multi-level cell capable of storing multiple bits
                per cell. The memory cells are grouped into words of fixed word length, for example, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,
                64 or 128 bits. Each word can be accessed by a binary address of N bits, making it possible to store 2N
                words in the memory.
